# LeoDJ KiCad library

This library contains all of my custom created symbols and footprints and also some I found online.  
They are not sorted in any way, because I don't have that many yet.

## Installation
You have to add the path to `LeoDJ-kicad\LeoDJ-kicad.3dshapes` as an environment variable named `LeoDJ_3D` for to 3D models to load.

## Symbols
